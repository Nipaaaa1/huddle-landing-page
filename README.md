## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

Responsive is **Hard**. I know I've said it everytime but still, it is hard.

### Continued development

I want to take some challenges that have some JS in the future, so I could use React to it's fullest

### Useful resources
